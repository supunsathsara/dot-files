# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for various Unix-based systems (like macOS and Linux). These configuration files are used to set up the system environment the way I prefer, automate installation processes, and maintain consistency across multiple machines.

## What's Inside?

A few of the notable dotfiles included are:

- `.zshrc`: Zsh configuration with custom prompt, aliases, and more.
- `.p10k.zsh`: Powerlevel10k theme settings for Zsh to create a beautiful and efficient prompt.
- `.zprofile`: Commands that run at the start of a login shell.

Other configurations might include Vim, Git, and TMUX setups.
